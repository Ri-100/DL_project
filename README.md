<h3 align="center">Dog breed prediction 🐕‍🦺</h3><br>



Steps to Perform - <br>
1. Load the dataset from Kaggle. IMPORTANT <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/catherinehorng/dogbreedidfromcomp/download"> Download Data set from Here </a> approx 750mb.<br>
2. Perform Resizing and Data Augmentation<br>
3. Models created <br>
   (i). CNN Model 1**: This model is a convolutional neural network designed specifically for dog breed prediction.<br>
   (ii). Different CNN Model 2**: Another CNN architecture but increased number of epochs.<br>
   (iii). Different CNN Model 3**: A variant of CNN architecture optimized for improved accuracy in dog breed classification by adding one-more layer.<br>
   (iv). VGG Model**: Utilizes the VGG architecture for dog breed prediction tasks.<br>
   (v). AlexNet Model**: Implements the AlexNet architecture for dog breed classification.<br>
   (vi). Final Model**: A composite model created by concatenating features from multiple pre-trained models:<br>
    - Inception Features<br>
    - Xception Features<br>
    - NASNet Features<br>
    - Inception ResNet Features<br><br>
    <b>The models were trained using a dataset of dog images. Please refer to the dataset documentation for information on how to obtain and preprocess the data.<b>
